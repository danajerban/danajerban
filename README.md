# 👋 Hey, I'm Erban

Welcome to my code corner!  
I spend my days wrangling TypeScript types, writing React components that don’t break (often), and occasionally telling Python to behave.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 Software Engineer at **The Coaching Masters** — Scaling video & audio infrastructure for 16K+ monthly learners
- 🌍 4+ years delivering 20+ projects across Europe — while actually traveling through it because the best debugging happens with a view
